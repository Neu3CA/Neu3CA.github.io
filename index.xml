      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a psychiatrist, prof dr Chris Baekens main interests are within the neurobiological field of Affective Disorders. To gain more insight in the underlying mechanisms of emotional brain processes in the ‘healthy’ as well as in the ‘mentally affected’ human brain, brain-imaging paradigms (MRI, fMRI, (S)PET,….) are used with or without the combination of neuromodulation techniques, such as rTMS and tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Marijke Miatton started her career as an assistant at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the Ghent University. In 2007 she fulfilled a PhD thesis on the topic “Neuropsychological functioning of children with a surgically corrected congenital heart defect” in collaboration with the Pediatric Department, Prof. D. De Wolf and Dr. K. François.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2008-2010 she worked as a post doctoral researcher at the Ghent University, Department of Internal Sciences. Since 2010, she is a full time psychologist at the Neurology Department of the Ghent University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She combines clinical work with research activities and since the majority of patients were provided by the Neurology Department of the Ghent University Hospital, she started to focus on neuropsychological functioning in patients with epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders. Together with the Reference Center for Refractory Epilepsy and the Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology, Neurobiology and Neuropsychology (LCEN-3), we investigated the effects of deep brain stimulation on the neuropsychological functioning of patients with refractory epilepsy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Prof. Helmstaedter from the University Clinic of Bonn, Marijke was responsible for the neuropsychological part of the international collaboration between the universities of Gent, Bonn and Freiburg on the study “Controlled Randomized Stimulation versus Resection”, a prospective randomized controlled study of neurostimulation in the medial temporal lobe for patients with medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Further, we have a good working collaboration with Prof. Dr. Aldenkamp and Dr. M. Hendriks of the Expertise Centrum Epilepsy, Sleep Disorders and Neurocognition from Kempenhaeghe, Heeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We further focus on the concordance of biomarkers and neuropsychological functioning in collaboration with Dr. A. Sieben en Dr. T. Van Langenhove neurologists with expertise in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marijke was also co-founder of Parkinson Zorgwijzer Vlaanderen, a initiative that strives for qualitatively better care for patients with Parkinson’s disease by providing specialized education to health care providers in Belgium. Marijke is a member of the Paramedic Board of the Belgian Stroke Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, she is a postdoctoral volunteer and is promoter of students for the faculties of Health Science, Medicine and Psychology in their scientific and clinical work on several neurological topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accelerated cognitive aging</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accelerated-cognitive-aging&#34;&gt;Accelerated cognitive aging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is not only characterized by seizures, but is also associated with cognitive problems. For example, global cognitive decline is reported in the context of chronic medication-resistant epilepsy, which may indicate a negative effect of accumulative seizures on the brain. However, it is largely unknown what percentage of patients is at risk for decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent interest is focused on the identification of risk factors and characterization of how cognitive functions develop in people with epilepsy. Evidence is found that the cognitive trajectory of patients with epilepsy over time differs from processes of cognitive ageing in healthy people, especially in adulthood-onset epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1889, Gowers introduced the concept of ‘epileptic dementia’. It has been suggested that this type of cognitive deterioration almost exclusively occurs in the context of the childhood-onset chronic (often medication-resistant) epilepsies where accumulation of medication  and seizures over decades leads to gradual decline of the higher cognitive functions. The final cognitive outcome of this ‘chronic accumulation model’ of decline can be similar to the cognitive outcome in some forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in daily clinical practice clinicians also encounter another possible form of cognitive decline that is less well described in literature. In a subgroup of adult patients with epilepsy who complain about cognition and a quite sudden inability to meet the demands of daily (working) life, cognitive functioning appears to be globally  deteriorated. These patients do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of epileptic dementia or a progressive neurological disease such as Alzheimer’s, nor neuropsychologically, nor clinically. The majority of these patients have an adult-onset epilepsy , so that they do not fit into the ‘chronic accumulation model’ of decline either. Cognitive deterioration in this subgroup may be ‘cascadic’ rather than progressive, thus: deterioration takes place in a relatively short period of time, and not as a consequence of chronicity. It these people with epilepsy on which we mainly focus within Neu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deterioration in this group develops in a stepwise ‘second hit model’ when epilepsy affects an already vulnerable brain. The model predicts loss of cognitive reserve capacity due to e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI) or old age leading to a cascade of events after a second hit, i.e. epilepsy. Processes of ageing may be accelerated due to this loss of brain plasticity and cognitive reserve capacity for which we coin the term ‘Accelerated Cognitive Ageing’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;centered&#34; src=&#34;https://neu3ca.github.io/img/ACAtrajectory.png&#34; alt=&#34;Drawing&#34; style=&#34;width: 1000px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graphical representation of Accelerated Cognitive Ageing. The dashed blue line represents the cognitive ageing trajectory without pathology. With increasing age, cognitive functioning is declining until the minimal cognitive threshold is reached. Two alternative cognitive ageing trajectories are shown. The yellow line depicts the cognitive trajectory after one hit (e.g. TBI). There is decline in cognitive function which recovers. Recovery is, however, not complete and results in a loss of functional reserve. This is followed by a normal rate of subsequent ageing. The solid red line represents Accelerated Cognitive Ageing in the second-hit model. After a second hit (e.g. epilepsy), cascadic deterioration takes place and does not recover due to the diminished cognitive reserve capacity. In combination and interaction with the expected changes of normal ageing, cognitive ageing is accelerated and the patient’s cognitive profile resembles that of an older individual. Published in: Breuer et al., 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the concept of accelerated cognitive ageing can be helpful in providing a framework understanding global cognitive deterioration in epilepsy. Moreover due to the cascadic character of the deterioration trajectory (in a short time period) in these patients, it offers a very promising model to study ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the Neu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CA program is to find specific brain abnormalities for accelerated cognitive aging and to develop treatment options for these patients. Thus, we aim to broaden the scope of epilepsy treatment options from merely seizure management to continuously protecting/preserving cognition. In a broader context, we expect that insights into accelerated cognitive aging are also relevant to understand and slow down healthy cognitive aging in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accelerated-cognitive-aging&#34;&gt;Accelerated cognitive aging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-standing concern has been whether epilepsy contributes to cognitive decline or so-called ‘epileptic dementia’. Although global cognitive decline is generally reported in the context of chronic refractory epilepsy (i.e. epilepsy that does not respond to medication), it is largely unknown what percentage of patients is at risk for decline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data-mining and graph analysis of EEG data</title>
      <link>https://neu3ca.github.io/project/EEG_graph_datamining/</link>

      <guid>https://neu3ca.github.io/project/EEG_graph_datamining/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this project, the human brain is represented as a complex network, where brain regions are the nodes of that network and weighted links between each two nodes shows their synchronization and communication frequency. For this purpose, EEG or MEG are used for measuring the activity of different brain regions. For quantifying the relationship between the brain regions, there are a lot of synchronization measures that can be chosen; with the help of those measurements, the functional brain network can be constructed and then modern network science offers a lot of tools to analyze the brain and finding/localizing differences between patients and healthy control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having robustly extracted the network structure from the data, the next step of this project is to combine network theoretical analysis with data mining and machine learning tools, in order to classify and cluster healthy brain connectivity patterns and brain patterns with some disorders. This may be used for sub-categorization of certain diseases (such as epilepsy), which may be relevant to develop tailored treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project relies on knowledge and expertise in signal processing, graph theory, physics and neurology.&lt;/p&gt;
