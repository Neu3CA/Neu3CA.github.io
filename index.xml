      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stephan studied mechatronics and biomedical engineering at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, obtaining his M.Sc. in 2012. He worked for 4 years in two industries (Industrial Automation and Enterprise Mobility) before acknowledging the gravity of his calling: becoming a neuroscientist. His broad interest lies in using our increasing grasp and control of technology to help us understand and educate each other on the comparatively unknown realm of the human brain. More specifically and currently, Stephan is working on finding a way to use real time feedback from fMRI brain scans towards treating cognitive impairments in epilepsy patients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Real-time fMRI neurofeedback</title>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;context&#34;&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A special application of &lt;a href=&#34;https://neu3ca.github.io/background/MRI&#34;&gt;functional MRI&lt;/a&gt; is real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-NF). In this modality, fMRI is used to access brain activity while the subject is in the scanner, and a certain measure of brain activity is presented back to the subject. The idea is that if a subject is aware of his/her ongoing brain activity, he/she can be trained to influence it. Although not in routine clinical practice, encouraging results have been obtained with rt-fMRI-NF. For example, certain cases of depression are characterized by reduced left amygdala activity. Using rt-fMRI-NF, depressed subjects can be trained to upregulate left amygdala activity, and their clinical symptoms improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-challenges&#34;&gt;Research challenges&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;a href=&#34;https://neu3ca.github.io/background/neu3ca&#34;&gt;Neu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;ca program&lt;/a&gt;  we are investigating rt-fMRI-NF as a way to mitigate cognitive impairment in &lt;a href=&#34;https://neu3ca.github.io/background/epilepsy&#34;&gt;epilepsy&lt;/a&gt;. Since complex brain functions such as cognition are typically mediated by brain networks (and not single regions), this includes implementing &lt;strong&gt;rt-fMRI-NF for networks&lt;/strong&gt; rather than stand-alone regions. Furthermore, we are looking for &lt;strong&gt;biomarkers of functional network impairment&lt;/strong&gt; that may be exploit for rt-fMRI-NF. Having identified these, they may be used to provide neurofeedback and to study the resulting &lt;strong&gt;changes in functional network organization&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clinical outcome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important issue is the &lt;strong&gt;sustainability&lt;/strong&gt; of the effect; how many training sessions are needed in order to have an effect that extends the rt-fMRI-NF session (i.e. also outside the scanner)? And how can these changes be maintained; do subjects need to a new session of rt-fMRI-NF trainings every now and then? At what interval? Or can we maybe prolong the effect using &lt;strong&gt;ambulatory and/or less expensive modalities&lt;/strong&gt; that assess brain activity (EEG neurofeedback, fNIRS neurofeedback)?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a psychiatrist, prof dr Chris Baekens main interests are within the neurobiological field of Affective Disorders. To gain more insight in the underlying mechanisms of emotional brain processes in the ‘healthy’ as well as in the ‘mentally affected’ human brain, brain-imaging paradigms (MRI, fMRI, (S)PET,….) are used with or without the combination of neuromodulation techniques, such as rTMS and tDCS.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://neu3ca.github.io/member/marijke/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Marijke Miatton started her career as an assistant at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences at the Ghent University. In 2007 she fulfilled a PhD thesis on the topic “Neuropsychological functioning of children with a surgically corrected congenital heart defect” in collaboration with the Pediatric Department, Prof. D. De Wolf and Dr. K. François.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From 2008-2010 she worked as a post doctoral researcher at the Ghent University, Department of Internal Sciences. Since 2010, she is a full time psychologist at the Neurology Department of the Ghent University Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She combines clinical work with research activities and since the majority of patients were provided by the Neurology Department of the Ghent University Hospital, she started to focus on neuropsychological functioning in patients with epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders. Together with the Reference Center for Refractory Epilepsy and the Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology, Neurobiology and Neuropsychology (LCEN-3), we investigated the effects of deep brain stimulation on the neuropsychological functioning of patients with refractory epilepsy with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Prof. Helmstaedter from the University Clinic of Bonn, Marijke was responsible for the neuropsychological part of the international collaboration between the universities of Gent, Bonn and Freiburg on the study “Controlled Randomized Stimulation versus Resection”, a prospective randomized controlled study of neurostimulation in the medial temporal lobe for patients with medically refractory medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Further, we have a good working collaboration with Prof. Dr. Aldenkamp and Dr. M. Hendriks of the Expertise Centrum Epilepsy, Sleep Disorders and Neurocognition from Kempenhaeghe, Heeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We further focus on the concordance of biomarkers and neuropsychological functioning in collaboration with Dr. A. Sieben en Dr. T. Van Langenhove neurologists with expertise in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Marijke was also co-founder of Parkinson Zorgwijzer Vlaanderen, a initiative that strives for qualitatively better care for patients with Parkinson’s disease by providing specialized education to health care providers in Belgium. Marijke is a member of the Paramedic Board of the Belgian Stroke Council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At last, she is a postdoctoral volunteer and is promoter of students for the faculties of Health Science, Medicine and Psychology in their scientific and clinical work on several neurological topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Robrecht Raedt was born September 19, 1980 in Kortrijk (Belgium). He obtained his Masters degree in Biology at Ghent University (Belgium) in 2002. In 2007, he successfully completed his PhD research at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of Ghent University. The topic of his PhD research was &amp;lsquo;Cell Therapy for Epilepsy&amp;rsquo;. This work implicated isolation and culture of stem cells, biochemical characterization of cell clones, cell grafting in various epilepsy models, immunohistochemistry, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He worked as a postdoc at the Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Neurophysiology, Neurobiology and Neuropsychology at Ghent University (LCEN3) on unraveling the mechanism of action of neurostimulation therapies for epilepsy (vagus nerve stimulation and deep brain stimulation) both in animal models as in patients with epilepsy. This work involved techniques such as microdialysis and intracranial electrophysiology in rats and single-unit recording in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since he was appointed as a Assistant Research Professor at Ghent University in 2011, Robrecht Raedt is doing research on the neural basis of behavioral control (cognitive and emotion control) using intracranial recording and neuromodulatory techniques during cognitive testing both in humans as in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robrecht Raedt was also associated to the University of Lethbridge (Dr. McNaughton lab) from 2012 to 2014 to investigate the neural dynamics leading to the development of  spontaneous epileptic seizures using high density recordings in the hippocampus of rodent models for epilepsy. In addition, he is involved in modulation of neural circuitry using optogenetics and DREADD technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Accelerated cognitive aging</title>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;accelerated-cognitive-aging&#34;&gt;Accelerated cognitive aging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is not only characterized by seizures, but is also associated with cognitive problems. For example, global cognitive decline is reported in the context of chronic medication-resistant epilepsy, which may indicate a negative effect of accumulative seizures on the brain. However, it is largely unknown what percentage of patients is at risk for decline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent interest is focused on the identification of risk factors and characterization of how cognitive functions develop in people with epilepsy. Evidence is found that the cognitive trajectory of patients with epilepsy over time differs from processes of cognitive ageing in healthy people, especially in adulthood-onset epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1889, Gowers introduced the concept of ‘epileptic dementia’. It has been suggested that this type of cognitive deterioration almost exclusively occurs in the context of the childhood-onset chronic (often medication-resistant) epilepsies where accumulation of medication  and seizures over decades leads to gradual decline of the higher cognitive functions. The final cognitive outcome of this ‘chronic accumulation model’ of decline can be similar to the cognitive outcome in some forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in daily clinical practice clinicians also encounter another possible form of cognitive decline that is less well described in literature. In a subgroup of adult patients with epilepsy who complain about cognition and a quite sudden inability to meet the demands of daily (working) life, cognitive functioning appears to be globally  deteriorated. These patients do not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of epileptic dementia or a progressive neurological disease such as Alzheimer’s, nor neuropsychologically, nor clinically. The majority of these patients have an adult-onset epilepsy , so that they do not fit into the ‘chronic accumulation model’ of decline either. Cognitive deterioration in this subgroup may be ‘cascadic’ rather than progressive, thus: deterioration takes place in a relatively short period of time, and not as a consequence of chronicity. It these people with epilepsy on which we mainly focus within Neu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deterioration in this group develops in a stepwise ‘second hit model’ when epilepsy affects an already vulnerable brain. The model predicts loss of cognitive reserve capacity due to e.g. traumatic brain injury (TBI) or old age leading to a cascade of events after a second hit, i.e. epilepsy. Processes of ageing may be accelerated due to this loss of brain plasticity and cognitive reserve capacity for which we coin the term ‘Accelerated Cognitive Ageing’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;centered&#34; src=&#34;https://neu3ca.github.io/img/ACAtrajectory.png&#34; alt=&#34;Drawing&#34; style=&#34;width: 1000px;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Graphical representation of Accelerated Cognitive Ageing. The dashed blue line represents the cognitive ageing trajectory without pathology. With increasing age, cognitive functioning is declining until the minimal cognitive threshold is reached. Two alternative cognitive ageing trajectories are shown. The yellow line depicts the cognitive trajectory after one hit (e.g. TBI). There is decline in cognitive function which recovers. Recovery is, however, not complete and results in a loss of functional reserve. This is followed by a normal rate of subsequent ageing. The solid red line represents Accelerated Cognitive Ageing in the second-hit model. After a second hit (e.g. epilepsy), cascadic deterioration takes place and does not recover due to the diminished cognitive reserve capacity. In combination and interaction with the expected changes of normal ageing, cognitive ageing is accelerated and the patient’s cognitive profile resembles that of an older individual. Published in: Breuer et al., 2016&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe that the concept of accelerated cognitive ageing can be helpful in providing a framework understanding global cognitive deterioration in epilepsy. Moreover due to the cascadic character of the deterioration trajectory (in a short time period) in these patients, it offers a very promising model to study ageing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aim of the Neu&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;CA program is to find specific brain abnormalities for accelerated cognitive aging and to develop treatment options for these patients. Thus, we aim to broaden the scope of epilepsy treatment options from merely seizure management to continuously protecting/preserving cognition. In a broader context, we expect that insights into accelerated cognitive aging are also relevant to understand and slow down healthy cognitive aging in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long-standing concern has been whether epilepsy contributes to cognitive decline or so-called ‘epileptic dementia’. Although global cognitive decline is generally reported in the context of chronic refractory epilepsy (i.e. epilepsy that does not respond to medication), it is largely unknown what percentage of patients is at risk for decline.&lt;/p&gt;

Evidence is found that the cognitive trajectory of patients with epilepsy over time differs from processes of cognitive ageing in healthy people, especially in adulthood-onset epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cognitive deterioration in these patients seems to develop in a ‘second hit model’ and occurs when epilepsy hits on a brain that is already vulnerable or vice versa when comorbid problems develop in a person with epilepsy. Processes of ageing may be accelerated due to loss of brain plasticity and cognitive reserve capacity for which we coin the term ‘accelerated cognitive ageing’.&lt;/p&gt;
